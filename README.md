## Computer Science Interests
### Artificial Intelligence
After becoming interested in AI at university, I took a research master's in it, created my own algorithm (dark matter-inspired gravitational swarm engine), and have been interested in it since.

Having previously worked on creating algorithms, I currently focus on how it's best implemented, looking at its strengths and weaknesses to ensure it works productively.

In addition to practical AIs, I've done work looking at "hard" AI, which begins to approach sentience and exists as its own entity.

### Programming
Having studied and worked as a programmer before getting into teaching, I still love coding today. My favourite languages are Python and C#. I've worked on projects in about 15 languages and enjoy learning new ones.

### Ethical Implications
Ethics are fascinating in CS. The developments made have big societal impacts, and it's important for us to be aware of this. Sadly, this is an area a lot of people have poor experiences with, but there's a lot to explore. My previous work has involved topics such as how we handle an emergent sentient AI (one that becomes sentient when we don't expect it), the impacts of mass automation of jobs, and the use of technology in military settings. Let me know if you have an area you think would be interesting to discuss in the course or if you'd like an example of a rough ethical situation I've had to face in the past.

## Repositories
My repositories available on here are largely resources for students. I have made and maintain the GitHub guides on our org along with behind-the-scenes guides. Any suggestions, please message me to discuss.
